#  About this project
This project is supposed to be a little pastime activity, and to hopefully build some small 2D or even 3D games in the future. This was all inspired and built upon jdh's work,
using his doomenstein repository for "inspiration". Here's the link: https://github.com/jdah/doomenstein-3d

# How to compile
Currently, since I am only able to work on linux, there is unfortunately only a bash script to compile and run this project for Linux. Worst case, I will never implement Windows compilability myself. Sorry
